PyXBMCt
=======

This repository contains a demo add-on for Kodi (XBMC) PyXBMCt framework.

PyXBMCt is a mini-framework which simplifies UI creation for XBMC addons. It was inspired by PyQt GUI framework (hence the name) and provides a main window and a number of controls (widgets). The main windows serves as a parent widget for the controls much like QtGui.QWidget class and provides a grid layout manager to place the controls.

An installable ZIP file for the demo addon can be downloaded from "Releases" section of this repository.

The documentation for the framework classes can be found here: https://romanvm.github.io/script.module.pyxbmct/

The framework uses image textures from Kodi Estuary and Confluence skins.
